Motivation: Collecting same set of show commands from multiple devices can a time consuming task.

Objective: Connecting to multiple devices and collecting show output.


Logic of Script:

The script takes its input from logindata.csv and commandset.yaml files.
Connects to multiple devices simultaneously to decrease runtime 
(I have taken 5 devices at a time, you can change this number as per your requirements)
The outputs is stored in file name : output.txt
script is written in python 3.

For test case i have hosted the script on a windows laptop and the devices it connects to are mostly cisco ios 
but it should work for any device supported in netmiko.

running time logs on the scripts have been shared in file : runtimeshelllogs
